## What I Learned? ü§î
The most important thing that I learned whilst working on this project is how \
the front-end communicates with the back-end and the database. \
<br>
Another skill I picked up along the way was deploying the entire application \
in the cloud using AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline.
